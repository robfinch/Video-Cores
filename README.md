# Video Cores

## Status
I really should fix-up this mess of cores. Many are only partially working. It represents a progression through the years.
For instance, there are several versions of the text controller, used in various projects. Different versions have different register sets and use different busses.
Check the date on the core to see the most recent incarnation. More recent cores are likely to be "improvements" on older cores.
